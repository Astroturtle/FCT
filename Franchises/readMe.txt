Alright, places! There's 5 lines involved here.

• Name- Self explanatory- what the name of the story. Typically, this will also be the file name. 
• Goals! These goals need to be accomplished for the story to be successful; mostly, they're the goals that the protagonists must complete to be successful.
• Reach Goals! These goals are bonuses! If the character's don't accomplish them, oh well, but if they do, bonus points to them. 
• Stetch Goals! These goals are the far out ones. Typically, if they're accomplished, the majority of the plot doesn't happen. 
• The character inserts! These are splitted with a "|", and just tell the things which characters to replace.
• Popularity (Low, Medium, High)- Be fair here. "Low" is some niche story- a YA novel or some random TV Show, "Medium" is something somewhat known (maybe the name has been heard, if not the properties), and "High" is something extremely well-known, like "Star Wars" or something.

Alright so other important notes: 
- If adding something, no commas, line breaks, or "|" in their names. 
- Be fair when ranking something- having a niche story nobody's ever heard of multiple days in a row is no fun for anyone.
- Submit merge requests and I'll try to figure out how that works? We'll see. Never collabed with people over GitHub before. 
- That's it! Thanks so much for your help with this project!
