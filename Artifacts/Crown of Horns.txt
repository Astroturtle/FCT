Crown of Horns
2) Franchise- Self explanatory. What franchise the artifact belongs too. Sometimes general, like "Star Wars" or "MCU", sometimes more specific, like "Avatar: The Last Airbender" vs "Legends of Korra". Use your discretion, but try to stay consistent.
3) Description- Describe the artifact!
4) Image- add an image URL for the artifact.
5) Link- Add an article where you can read more on the character.
6) Brand- What's the overarching brand?
7) Wielder- who classically wields the weapon? For Mjolnir, lots of characters have picked it up, but the main wielder is Thor. List all the classic wielders here, seperated by "|"
8) Tags- These are the important ones. Put some tags for traits the artifact might have that other artifact may share- sentient, history, wielder, etc. The important tag is Medium (like TV Shows, Video Games, etc.). Other then that, also add any groups they're associated with (such as "Jedi" or "Phantom Thieves"). 
9) Medium- What is this classically appearing in? Seperate with ",". 
10) Type- This ones another doozy. Put the type of artifact- weapon, vehicle, armor, etc.- and then the subtype (seperate type/subtype with "|"): Axe, Bow, Submarine, etc.
11) Sets- Add any sets this artifact belongs to, like the infinity stones. Seperate with "|".
12) Power Level! (Mundane, Slightly-Magical, City, Country, World, Cosmic, Interuniversal, Omnipotent)- This one's, once again, quite subjective. What's the biggest amount of property they could destroy before someone stopped them? Just guess, and someone may fact-check you later!
13) Popularity (Low, Medium, High)- Be fair here. "Low" is some niche weapon from a YA novel or a TV Show, "Medium" is something somewhat known (maybe the name has been heard, if not the properties), and "High" is something extremely well-known, like "Mjolnir" or something.
